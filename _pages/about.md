I am a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University with research interests in public, crime, urban, and health economics. My research agenda attempts to understand the role of different actors involved in issues related to drug abuse, such as the police, health care professionals, and pharmaceutical companies, and how they interact with the demand-side, such as heavy users, patients, and children. I am particularly interested in the management and consequences of drug epidemics and discretion in the criminal justice system. 

I am on the job market for the 2022-2023 academic year. My job market paper, "Disrupting Drug Markets: The Effects of Crackdowns on Rogue Opioid Suppliers," examines the direct and spillover effects of supply-side enforcement within the prescription opioid market.

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
