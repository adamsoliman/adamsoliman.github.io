I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research interests in public, crime, and urban. I am particularly interested in the causes and consequences of drug epidemics and discretion in the criminal justice system.  

I am on the job market for the 2022-2023 academic year. My job market paper, "Disrupting Drug Markets: The Effects of Crackdowns on Opioid Suppliers," examines the direct and spillover effects of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) crackdowns on rogue doctors and pharmacies in the prescription opioid market.

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
