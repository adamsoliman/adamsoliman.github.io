I am an applied microeconomist focusing on crime, health, and education. I am particularly interested in the role of different actors involved in issues related to drug abuse, primarily health care professionals and the police, and how they interact with the demand-side, such as patients, heavy users, and students. 

Please find my CV [here](https://adamsoliman.github.io/files/AdamSolimanCV.pdf).

Before graduate school, I [taught math and economics in Dubai](https://adamsoliman.github.io/teaching/) and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
