I am an applied microeconomist focusing on drug markets, policing, and neighborhoods, and I am an assistant professor of economics at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/business/departments/economics/index.html). Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the London School of Economics after earning my Ph.D. in economics from Duke University in 2023. Before graduate school, I was a primary and secondary school [teacher in Dubai](https://adamsoliman.github.io/teaching/).
