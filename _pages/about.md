I am an assistant professor of economics at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/business/departments/economics/index.html) and a research associate at the [Centre for Economic Performance](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/) at the London School of Economics. I am an applied microeconomist focusing on drug markets, policing, and neighborhoods. 

I was previously a postdoctoral scholar at the London School of Economics after receiving my Ph.D. from Duke University in May 2023. Prior to my life as an economist, I was a primary and secondary school [teacher in Dubai](https://adamsoliman.github.io/teaching/) and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
