I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research interests in public, environmental, and development economics. 

My research focuses on the economics of crime and education, where I study criminal capital formation, the behavior of rebel groups, and neighborhood crime dynamics.

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to travel.
