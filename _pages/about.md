I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research interests in public, crime, and education. I am particularly interested in the causes and consequences of drug epidemics and discretion in the criminal justice system. My job market paper, "Disrupting Drug Markets: Evidence from the Opioid Epidemic," examines the direct and spillover effects of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) crackdowns on rogue supply chain actors in a controlled substance market. 

I will be on the job market during the 2022-2023 academic year. 

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
