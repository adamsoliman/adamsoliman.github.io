I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research interests in public economics, the economics of education, and environmental economics. I study topics at the intersection of community health, public policy, and enforcement, and I am particularly interested in the role and impacts of discretion in enforcement decisions. My current projects focus on the opioid epidemic, criminal capital formation, and prosecutorial incentives. 

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to travel.
