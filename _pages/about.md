I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research interests in public, environmental, and development economics. 

My research focuses on the economics of crime, where I study neighborhood crime dynamics, prosecutorial discretion, and the behavior of rebel groups. My dissertation examines the interactions between schools and criminal activity. 

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to travel.
