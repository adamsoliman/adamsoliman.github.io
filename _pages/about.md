I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research interests in public economics, the economics of education, and environmental economics. I study topics at the intersection of community health, public policy, and crime, where I am particularly interested in the role and impacts of discretion in enforcement decisions. 

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
