I am an applied microeconomist focusing on illicit drug markets, policing, neighborhood dynamics, and peer interactions.

*I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Economics](https://www.clemson.edu/business/departments/economics/index.html) at Clemson University and a Research Associate at the [Centre for Economic Performance](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/) at the London School of Economics.*

In May 2023, I received my Ph.D. from Duke University and spent the following academic year as a postdoctoral scholar at the London School of Economics. Prior to my life as an economist, I was a primary and secondary school [teacher in Dubai](https://adamsoliman.github.io/teaching/) and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
