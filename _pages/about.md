I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research fields in public economics, the economics of education, and environmental economics. My research focuses on criminal capital formation, discretion in the criminal justice system, and the behavior of rebel groups.

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to travel.
