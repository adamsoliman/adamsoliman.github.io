I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Duke University with research interests in public, environmental, and development economics. 

My research focuses on the economics of crime, where I am particularly interested in the incentives of police and prosecutors and the behavior of rebel groups. 

Before starting graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to travel.
