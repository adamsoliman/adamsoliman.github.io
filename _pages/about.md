I am a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University with research interests in the economics of crime, health economics, and public economics. I am particularly interested in the role of different actors involved in issues related to drug abuse and crime, such as the police, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies, and how they interact with the demand-side, such as heavy users, patients, and students.

Before graduate school, I taught math and economics in Dubai and took a year off to [travel](https://twitter.com/adamksoliman/status/1402014895214776331?s=20&t=kWelDx7GIkrv42lqRBRhfQ).
