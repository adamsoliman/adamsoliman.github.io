<p>
  I am an applied microeconomist focusing on drug markets, policing, and neighborhoods, and I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/business/departments/economics/index.html" target="_blank">Clemson University</a>. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the London School of Economics after earning my Ph.D. in Economics from Duke University in 2023. Before graduate school, I was a primary and secondary <a href="https://adamsoliman.github.io/teaching/" target="_blank">school teacher</a> in Dubai.
