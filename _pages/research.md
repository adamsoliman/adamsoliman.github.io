**Abstract:** Every state imposes harsher punishments for drug offenses committed near schools. These "drug-free school zones" (DFSZs) aim to deter crime from entering schoolyards, but they also give significant discretionary power to police, as they can expose offenders to additional risk for the same criminal activity. I exploit a sudden reduction in DFSZ size in order to examine offender and enforcement behavior and find an 18% decrease in drug arrests in "de-zoned" areas one year after the reform. There is no displacement of non-drug offenses and majority black neighborhoods have a larger decline in drug arrests. If offenders were significantly deterred by harsher penalties, as the law intended and Becker's (1968) model predicts, there should be an increase in drug arrests. I therefore conclude that police respond to changes in punishment, where punishment severity and enforcement effort are complementary. Additionally, two concerns commonly associated with the "War on Drugs" view of weakening drug crime penalties, crime displacement and an increase in drug use, are not substantiated in this setting.
