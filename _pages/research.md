## Job Market Paper
### Disrupting Drug Markets: The Effects of Crackdowns on Rogue Opioid Suppliers (Draft Coming Soon)

**Abstract**: The US government attempts to reduce drug abuse primarily through supply-side interventions. Evidence from illegal drug markets suggests that these crackdowns lead to either crime displacement or drug substitution. Almost no research exists on the impacts of this approach in a legal drug market, where the vast majority of drug epidemics originate. In this paper, I identify the causal impacts of prescription opioid supplier crackdowns on legal drug supply, diverted opioid pill prices, and health outcomes. Leveraging random audits of doctors and pharmacies that lead to controlled substance license revocations, I find that crackdowns cause large decreases in local opioid dispensing that persist across space and time. This sustained reduction in legal supply leads to increases in street pill prices and heroin overdose deaths but to decreases in overall mortality. These results indicate that substitution to heroin is limited to existing heavy users and that targeted enforcement reduces the number of light users. The policy implication is that enforcement should occur earlier in a drug epidemic, or treatment programs need to compliment supply-side interventions.

### [Crime and (a Preference for) Punishment: The Effects of Drug Policy Reform on Policing Activity](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3795758)

Forthcoming, *The Journal of Law and Economics*, 2022

**Abstract**: We still know very little about the incentives of police. Using geocoded crime data and a novel source of within-city variation in punishment severity, I am able to shed light on enforcement behavior. I find that in parts of a city where drug sale penalties were weakened, there is a 13% decrease in all drug arrests. There is no displacement of non-drug offenses. If offenders were significantly deterred by harsher penalties, as the law intended and Becker’s (1968) model predicts, drug arrests should have increased in areas with weaker penalties. My results are therefore consistent with police treating enforcement effort and punishment severity as complements. I also find that city-wide crime and drug use do not increase after the reform. This paper thus calls into question the "War on Drugs" view of punishment and suggests that certain types of enforcement can be reduced without incurring large public safety costs. 	

### [Prescriptive Drought Policy and Water Supplier Compliance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180092200091X?dgcid=author)
*Ecological Economics*, 2022

**Abstract**: Governments often cannot use prices to induce water conservation, and the need to understand the impacts of alternate methods is growing due to increased variability in water resources. During the 2012-2016 drought in California, a period that may presage the future of water management in a warmer climate, the state attempted to manage water use through a set of mandatory restrictions that assigned each of California's 412 largest urban water suppliers to one of nine conservation tiers; those with greater historic usage needed to conserve more. I find that even though significant statewide savings occurred, only half of all suppliers complied with their conservation target. Moreover, the increased savings were not caused by the tiered design of the mandate: evidence from a regression discontinuity design shows that suppliers that just missed a stricter conservation tier actually conserved more. Additionally, water use rebounded after the regulation was removed, implying that variable adjustments in demand contributed more to water use savings than fixed cost household investments. Given the significant costs of water regulation and the high probability of future droughts, the policy implication is that both governments and water suppliers may benefit from investments in water supply reliability and less complex prescriptive policies.

### Rebel Funding Strategies: Illicit Activities, Natural Resources, and Substitution Behavior 

**Abstract**: Rebel groups often exploit natural resources in order to finance their operations, yet we still know little about their basic funding decisions. Given the prevalence of asymmetric warfare, I examine how rebel groups choose between funding strategies using a unique panel dataset on the activities of 297 groups. I find that when the world price of a natural resource they exploit rises, rebel groups substitute away from extortion, smuggling, kidnapping, and theft. These results suggest that policies attempting to shut down these groups by cutting their main sources of funding may produce harmful unintended consequences in the short run.
