## Publications and Working Papers

* **[Disrupting Drug Markets: The Effects of Crackdowns on Rogue Opioid Suppliers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266020)**

    <span style="display: block; margin-top: -12px; line-height: 1;">*American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*, Forthcoming <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleText('abstractdocs')" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">Show Abstract</button>
<div id="abstractdocs" style="display: none;">
This paper estimates the impacts of doctor crackdowns on the quantity demanded of prescription opioids, across-market substitution, and across-product substitution. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the timing and location of administrative actions, I find that cracking down on a single doctor decreases county-level opioid dispensing by 10%. This decline persists across space and grows over time. Additionally, significant heroin substitution occurs, yet overall overdose mortality decreases. These results highlight a critical tradeoff policymakers should consider with targeted crackdowns: reductions in the flow of new users must be balanced against the harm that arises when existing users substitute to more dangerous drugs.

* **[What Fueled the Illicit Opioid Epidemic?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5114929)** (with J. Travis Donahoe)

    <span style="display: block; margin-top: -12px; line-height: 1;">*Working Paper*, 2025 <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleText('abstracttakeover')" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">Show Abstract</button>
<div id="abstracttakeover" style="display: none;">
In recent years, illicitly manufactured opioids—primarily heroin and fentanyl—have surpassed prescription opioids as the leading cause of overdose deaths in the United States. We provide the first causal evidence on the role of geographically concentrated heroin potency shocks in driving this transition. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages the fact that cities with white powder heroin markets—but not those with black tar heroin—were exposed to supply chain shifts beginning in 2012 that increased the variability of heroin purity and the prevalence of fentanyl adulteration, we estimate that these shocks more than doubled all-cause overdose death rates through 2019 and account for the majority of the rise in illicit opioid deaths during that period. Previously studied interventions aimed at curbing prescription opioid supply cannot explain these effects. Our findings also help reconcile previously unexplained patterns in the opioid epidemic, namely the sharp geographic shift in overdose deaths toward eastern states and rising mortality among groups with limited prior exposure to the prescription opioid epidemic.

* **[Better Stealing than Dealing: How do Felony Theft Thresholds Impact Crime?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5169572)** (with Steve Billings, Mike Makowsky, and Kevin Schnepel)

    <span style="display: block; margin-top: -12px; line-height: 1;">*Working Paper*, 2025 <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleText('abstracttheft')" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">Show Abstract</button>
<div id="abstracttheft" style="display: none;">
From 2005 to 2019, forty US states increased the dollar value threshold delineating misdemeanor and felony theft, reducing the expected punishment for a subset of property crimes. Using an event study framework, we observe significant and growing increases in theft after a state reform is passed. We then show that reduced sanctions for theft have broader effects in the market for illegal activity. Consistent with a mechanism of substitution across income-generating crimes, we find decreases in both drug distribution crimes and the probability that a released offender previously convicted of drug distribution is reincarcerated for a new drug conviction.

* **[The Social Spillovers of Homeownership: Evidence from Institutional Investors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4649479)** (with Steve Billings)

    <span style="display: block; margin-top: -12px; line-height: 1;">*Working Paper*, 2023 <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleText('abstracthomes')" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">Show Abstract</button>
<div id="abstracthomes" style="display: none;">
We provide novel evidence on the social spillovers of homeownership by exploiting the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes and converting them to permanent rentals. Using a granular difference-in-differences design based on proximity to a single investor-purchased property, we find that neighboring property values decline by 1% relative to those slightly farther away. This decline grows over time yet decays across space, and these same properties experience increases in crime and decreases in property maintenance and voter registration. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the observed externalities are primarily driven by changes in ownership rather than tenant behavior.

* **[Crime and (a Preference for) Punishment: The Effects of Drug Policy Reform on Policing Activity](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/721292)**

    <span style="display: block; margin-top: -12px; line-height: 1;">*The Journal of Law and Economics*, 2022 <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleText('abstractdfsz')" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">Show Abstract</button>
<div id="abstractdfsz" style="display: none;">
We still know very little about the incentives of police. Using geocoded crime data and a novel source of within-city variation in punishment severity, I am able to shed light on enforcement behavior. I find that in parts of a city where drug sale penalties were weakened, there is a 13% decrease in all drug arrests. There is no displacement of non-drug offenses. If offenders were significantly deterred by harsher penalties, as the law intended and Becker’s (1968) model predicts, drug arrests should have increased in areas with weaker penalties. My results are therefore consistent with police treating enforcement effort and punishment severity as complements. I also find that city-wide crime and drug use do not increase after the reform. This paper thus calls into question the "War on Drugs" view of punishment and suggests that certain types of enforcement can be reduced without incurring large public safety costs.
