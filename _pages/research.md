  <div id="abstractdocs" class="abstract">
    This paper estimates the impacts of doctor crackdowns on the quantity demanded of prescription opioids, across-market substitution, and across-product substitution. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the timing and location of administrative actions, I find that cracking down on a single doctor decreases county-level opioid dispensing by 10%. This decline persists across space and grows over time. Additionally, significant heroin substitution occurs, yet overall overdose mortality decreases. These results highlight a critical tradeoff policymakers should consider with targeted crackdowns: reductions in the flow of new users must be balanced against the harm that arises when existing users substitute to more dangerous drugs.

  <div id="abstractdfsz" class="abstract">
    Using geocoded crime data and a novel source of within-city variation in punishment severity, I find that in parts of a city where drug sale penalties were weakened, there is a 13% decrease in all drug arrests. There is no displacement of non-drug offenses. My results are consistent with police treating enforcement effort and punishment severity as complements. City-wide crime and drug use do not increase after the reform, suggesting that certain enforcement can be reduced without large public safety costs.

  <div id="abstractwater" class="abstract">
    During California’s 2012–2016 drought, the state managed water use through mandatory conservation tiers. I find that only half of all suppliers complied with their targets, and the increased savings were not driven by the tiered design. Water use rebounded after the regulation was removed, implying that variable adjustments in demand contributed more to savings than fixed-cost investments.

    From 2005 to 2019, forty US states increased the dollar value threshold delineating misdemeanor and felony theft. We observe significant and growing increases in theft after a reform, along with decreases in drug distribution crimes and reincarceration for new drug convictions.

    We show that geographically concentrated shocks to heroin potency drove recent surges in U.S. overdose mortality. Exposure to these shocks increased overdose death rates by 52% through 2019, emphasizing the dangers of volatility in illicit drug supply and the role of supply-side dynamics.

    Using a granular difference-in-differences design based on proximity to investor-purchased properties, we find that neighboring property values decline by 1%, while crime increases and voter registration decreases. These externalities arise from both landlord practices and tenant composition.
